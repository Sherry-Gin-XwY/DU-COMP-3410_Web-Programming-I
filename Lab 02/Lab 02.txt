In this class, I hope I can learn something interesting about Internet.
for example: how does the internet work.

There is a japanese game which I plays it every day. However, that game has territorial restrictions.
That's mean it is only playable in Japan. if I log in in other place likes USA, China...
it would show a message say I'm not able to play that games unless I log in it in Japan. There are many ways to
play this game. The simple one is using the VPN to change the IP address. 

But there are some ways which I hope I can know 
how does it work. Changing and add some IP address in the hosts file in the computer; and use cookie in the browser.

I also want to know how to create a beautiful website by myself.
